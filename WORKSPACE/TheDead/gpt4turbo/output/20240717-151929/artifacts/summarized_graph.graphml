      <data key="d0">"PERSON"</data>
      <data key="d1">Gretta is depicted as a complex and emotionally rich character, deeply intertwined with her husband Gabriel's life and emotional journey. She is Gabriel's wife, a role that has seen her nursing his mother during her last illness, despite facing criticism from her. This aspect of her character showcases her caring nature and resilience. Gretta's relationship with Gabriel is marked by moments of intimacy and reflection, notably observed when Gabriel sees her in a moment of contemplation, triggered by the song 'The Lass of Aughrim' sung by Mr. D'Arcy. This song evokes a strong emotional response in Gretta, revealing her nostalgic and sorrowful connection to her past in Galway, particularly to a young boy named Michael Furey, whom she knew and who died young. Her reminiscence about Michael Furey highlights a depth of feeling and a capacity for remembering those she has lost, which significantly affects her present emotional state.

Moreover, Gretta's character is portrayed walking ahead of Gabriel, symbolizing perhaps her leading role in his emotional awakening and the depth of her own inner life. She is central to Gabriel's emotional journey, serving as a catalyst for his self-reflection and deeper understanding of himself and his feelings. The mention of a potential excursion to the Aran Isles further connects Gretta to Connacht, suggesting her roots and her connection to Ireland's geography and culture, which enriches her character's background and adds layers to her identity.

In summary, Gretta is a serious and weary yet deeply caring and emotionally complex character. Her interactions with Gabriel, coupled with her own personal history and emotional depth, play a crucial role in the narrative, making her an essential figure in understanding the emotional landscape and the themes of memory, loss, and the search for meaning.</data>

Her actions and opinions have a significant impact on Gabriel, as she is mentioned to have praised his review while also maintaining a critical perspective that causes him unease. Gabriel perceives her departure from the event as discourteous, highlighting her importance in the narrative even in her absence. Miss Ivors' character is complex, embodying passion for cultural identity, a critical mind, and a boldness in social interactions.</data>
