Gabriel stood stock-still for a moment in astonishment and then followed her. As he passed in the way of the cheval-glass he caught sight of himself in full length, his broad, wellfilled shirt-front, the face whose expression always puzzled him when he saw it in a mirror, and his glimmering gilt-rimmed eyeglasses. He halted a few paces from her and said:\n\n\"What about the song? Why does that make you cry?\"\n\nShe raised her head from her arms and dried her eyes with the back of her hand like a child. A kinder note than he had intended went into his voice.\n\n\"Why, Gretta?\" he asked.\n\n\"I am thinking about a person long ago who used to sing that song.\"\n\n\"And who was the person long ago?\" asked Gabriel, smiling.\n\n\"It was a person I used to know in Galway when I was living with my grandmother,\" she said.\n\nThe smile passed away from Gabriel's face. A dull anger began to gather again at the back of his mind and the dull fires of his lust began to glow angrily in his veins.\n\n\"Someone you were in love with?\" he asked ironically.\n\"It was a young boy I used to know,\" she answered, \"named Michael Furey. He used to sing that song, The Lass of Aughrim. He was very delicate.\"\n\nGabriel was silent. He did not wish her to think that he was interested in this delicate boy.\n\n\"I can see him so plainly,\" she said, after a moment. \"Such eyes as he had: big, dark eyes! And such an expression in them\u2014an expression!\"\n\n\"O, then, you are in love with him?\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"I used to go out walking with him,\" she said, \"when I was in Galway.\"\n\nA thought flew across Gabriel's mind.\n\n\"Perhaps that was why you wanted to go to Galway with that Ivors girl?\" he said coldly.\n\nShe looked at him and asked in surprise:\n\n\"What for?\"\n\nHer eyes made Gabriel feel awkward. He shrugged his shoulders and said:\n\n\"How do I know? To see him, perhaps.\"\n\nShe looked away from him along the shaft of light towards the window in silence.\n\n\"He is dead,\" she said at length. \"He died when he was only seventeen. Isn't it a terrible thing to die so young as that?\"\n\n\"What was he?\" asked Gabriel, still ironically.\n\n\"He was in the gasworks,\" she said.\n\nGabriel felt humiliated by the failure of his irony and by the evocation of this figure from the dead, a boy in the gasworks. While he had been full of memories of their secret life together, full of tenderness and joy and desire, she had been comparing him in her mind with another. A shameful consciousness of his own person assailed him. He saw himself as a ludicrous figure, acting as a pennyboy for his aunts, a nervous, well-meaning sentimentalist, orating to vulgarians and idealising his own clownish lusts, the pitiable fatuous fellow he had caught a glimpse of in the mirror. Instinctively he turned his back more to the light lest she might see the shame that burned upon his forehead.\n\nHe tried to keep up his tone of cold interrogation, but his voice when he spoke was humble and indifferent.\n\n\"I suppose you were in love with this Michael Furey, Gretta,\" he said.\n\n\"I was great with him at that time,\" she said.\n\nHer voice was veiled and sad. Gabriel, feeling now how vain it would be to try to lead her whither he had purposed, caressed one of her hands and said, also sadly:\n\n\"And what did he die of so young, Gretta? Consumption, was it?\"\n\n\"I think he died for me,\" she answered.\n\nA vague terror seized Gabriel at this answer, as if, at that hour when he had hoped to triumph, some impalpable and vindictive being was coming against him, gathering forces against him in its vague world. But he shook himself free of it with an effort of reason and continued to caress her hand. He did not question her again, for he felt that she would tell him of herself. Her hand was warm and moist: it did not respond to his touch, but he continued to caress it just as he had caressed her first letter to him that spring morning.\n\n\"It was in the winter,\" she said, \"about the beginning of the winter when I was going to leave my grandmother's and come up here to the convent. And he was ill at the time in his lodgings in Galway and wouldn't be let out, and his people in Oughterard were written to. He was in decline, they said, or something like that. I never knew rightly.\"\n\nShe paused for a moment and sighed.\n\n\"Poor fellow,\" she said. \"He was very fond of me and he was such a gentle boy. We used to go out together, walking, you know, Gabriel, like the way they do in the country. He was going to study singing only for his health. He had a very good voice, poor Michael Furey.\"\n\n\"Well; and then?\" asked Gabriel.\n\n\"And then when it came to the time for me to leave Galway and come up to the convent he was much worse and I wouldn't be let see him so I wrote him a letter saying I was going up to Dublin and would be back in the summer, and hoping he would be better then.\"\n\nShe paused for a moment to get her voice under control, and then went on:\n\n\"Then the night before I left,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
