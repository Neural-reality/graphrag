He did not know how to meet her charge. He wanted to say that literature was above politics. But they were friends of many years' standing and their careers had been parallel, first at the University and then as teachers: he could not risk a grandiose phrase with her. He continued blinking his eyes and trying to smile and murmured lamely that he saw nothing political in writing reviews of books.\n\nWhen their turn to cross had come he was still perplexed and inattentive. Miss Ivors promptly took his hand in a warm grasp and said in a soft friendly tone:\n\n\"Of course, I was only joking. Come, we cross now.\"\n\nWhen they were together again she spoke of the University question and Gabriel felt more at ease. A friend of hers had shown her his review of Browning's poems. That was how she had found out the secret: but she liked the review immensely. Then she said suddenly:\n\n\"O, Mr. Conroy, will you come for an excursion to the Aran Isles this summer? We're going to stay there a whole month. It will be splendid out in the Atlantic. You ought to come. Mr. Clancy is coming, and Mr. Kilkelly and Kathleen Kearney. It would be splendid for Gretta too if she'd come. She's from Connacht, isn't she?\"\n\n\"Her people are,\" said Gabriel shortly.\n\n\"But you will come, won't you?\" said Miss Ivors, laying her warm hand eagerly on his arm.\n\n\"The fact is,\" said Gabriel, \"I have just arranged to go\u2014\"\n\n\"Go where?\" asked Miss Ivors.\n\n\"Well, you know, every year I go for a cycling tour with some fellows and so\u2014\"\n\n\"But where?\" asked Miss Ivors.\n\n\"Well, we usually go to France or Belgium or perhaps Germany,\" said Gabriel awkwardly.\n\n\"And why do you go to France and Belgium,\" said Miss Ivors, \"instead of visiting your own land?\"\n\n\"Well,\" said Gabriel, \"it's partly to keep in touch with the languages and partly for a change.\"\n\n\"And haven't you your own language to keep in touch with\u2014Irish?\" asked Miss Ivors.\n\n\"Well,\" said Gabriel, \"if it comes to that, you know, Irish is not my language.\"\n\nTheir neighbours had turned to listen to the cross-examination. Gabriel glanced right and left nervously and tried to keep his good humour under the ordeal which was making a blush invade his forehead.\n\n\"And haven't you your own land to visit,\" continued Miss Ivors, \"that you know nothing of, your own people, and your own country?\"\n\n\"O, to tell you the truth,\" retorted Gabriel suddenly, \"I'm sick of my own country, sick of it!\"\n\n\"Why?\" asked Miss Ivors.\n\nGabriel did not answer for his retort had heated him.\n\n\"Why?\" repeated Miss Ivors.\n\nThey had to go visiting together and, as he had not answered her, Miss Ivors said warmly:\n\n\"Of course, you've no answer.\"\n\nGabriel tried to cover his agitation by taking part in the dance with great energy. He avoided her eyes for he had seen a sour expression on her face. But when they met in the long chain he was surprised to feel his hand firmly pressed. She looked at him from under her brows for a moment quizzically until he smiled. Then, just as the chain was about to start again, she stood on tiptoe and whispered into his ear:\n\n\"West Briton!\"\n\nWhen the lancers were over Gabriel went away to a remote corner of the room where Freddy Malins' mother was sitting. She was a stout feeble old woman with white hair. Her voice had a catch in it like her son's and she stuttered slightly. She had been told that Freddy had come and that he was nearly all right. Gabriel asked her whether she had had a good crossing. She lived with her married daughter in Glasgow and came to Dublin on a visit once a year. She answered placidly that she had had a beautiful crossing and that the captain had been most attentive to her. She spoke also of the beautiful house her daughter kept in Glasgow, and of all the friends they had there. While her tongue rambled on Gabriel tried to banish from his mind all memory of the unpleasant incident with Miss Ivors. Of course the girl or woman, or whatever she was, was an enthusiast but there was a time for all things. Perhaps he ought not to have answered her like that. But she had no right to call him a West Briton before people, even in joke. She had tried to make him ridiculous before people, heckling him and staring at him with her rabbit's eyes.\n\nHe saw his wife making her way towards him through the waltzing couples. When she reached him she said into his ear:\n\n\"Gabriel, Aunt Kate wants to know won't you carve the goose as usual. Miss Daly will carve the ham and I'll do the pudding.\"\n\n\"All right,\" said Gabriel.\n\n\"She's sending in the younger ones first as soon as this waltz is over so that we'll have the table to ourselves.\"\n\n\"Were you dancing?\" asked Gabriel.\n\n\"Of course I was. Didn't you see me? What row had you with Molly Ivors?\"\n\n\"No row. Why? Did she say so?\"\n\n\"Something like that. I'm trying to get that Mr. D'Arcy to sing. He's full of conceit, I think.\"\n\n\"There was no row,\" said Gabriel moodily, \"only she wanted me to go for a trip to the west of Ireland and I said I wouldn't.\"\n\nHis wife clasped her hands excitedly and gave a little jump.\n\n\"O, do go, Gabriel,\" she cried. \"I'd love\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4-turbo-preview", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
