The two aunts laughed heartily, too, for Gabriel's solicitude was a standing joke with them.\n\n\"Goloshes!\" said Mrs. Conroy. \"That's the latest. Whenever it's wet underfoot I must put on my goloshes. To-night even, he wanted me to put them on, but I wouldn't. The next thing he'll buy me will be a diving suit.\"\n\nGabriel laughed nervously and patted his tie reassuringly, while Aunt Kate nearly doubled herself, so heartily did she enjoy the joke. The smile soon faded from Aunt Julia's face and her mirthless eyes were directed towards her nephew's face. After a pause she asked:\n\n\"And what are goloshes, Gabriel?\"\n\n\"Goloshes, Julia!\" exclaimed her sister. \"Goodness me, don't you know what goloshes are? You wear them over your . . . over your boots, Gretta, isn't it?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Conroy. \"Guttapercha things. We both have a pair now. Gabriel says everyone wears them on the continent.\"\n\n\"O, on the continent,\" murmured Aunt Julia, nodding her head slowly.\n\nGabriel knitted his brows and said, as if he were slightly angered:\n\n\"It's nothing very wonderful, but Gretta thinks it very funny because she says the word reminds her of Christy Minstrels.\"\n\n\"But tell me, Gabriel,\" said Aunt Kate, with brisk tact. \"Of course, you've seen about the room. Gretta was saying . . .\"\n\n\"O, the room is all right,\" replied Gabriel. \"I've taken one in the Gresham.\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" said Aunt Kate, \"by far the best thing to do. And the children, Gretta, you're not anxious about them?\"\n\n\"O, for one night,\" said Mrs. Conroy. \"Besides, Bessie will look after them.\"\n\n\"To be sure,\" said Aunt Kate again. \"What a comfort it is to have a girl like that, one you can depend on! There's that Lily, I'm sure I don't know what has come over her lately. She's not the girl she was at all.\"\n\nGabriel was about to ask his aunt some questions on this point, but she broke off suddenly to gaze after her sister, who had wandered down the stairs and was craning her neck over the banisters.\n\n\"Now, I ask you,\" she said almost testily, \"where is Julia going? Julia! Julia! Where are you going?\"\n\nJulia, who had gone half way down one flight, came back and announced blandly:\n\n\"Here's Freddy.\"\n\nAt the same moment a clapping of hands and a final flourish of the pianist told that the waltz had ended. The drawing-room door was opened from within and some couples came out. Aunt Kate drew Gabriel aside hurriedly and whispered into his ear:\n\"Slip down, Gabriel, like a good fellow and see if he's all right, and don't let him up if he's screwed. I'm sure he's screwed. I'm sure he is.\"\n\nGabriel went to the stairs and listened over the banisters. He could hear two persons talking in the pantry. Then he recognised Freddy Malins' laugh. He went down the stairs noisily.\n\n\"It's such a relief,\" said Aunt Kate to Mrs. Conroy, \"that Gabriel is here. I always feel easier in my mind when he's here. . . . Julia, there's Miss Daly and Miss Power will take some refreshment. Thanks for your beautiful waltz, Miss Daly. It made lovely time.\"\n\nA tall wizen-faced man, with a stiff grizzled moustache and swarthy skin, who was passing out with his partner, said:\n\n\"And may we have some refreshment, too, Miss Morkan?\"\n\n\"Julia,\" said Aunt Kate summarily, \"and here's Mr. Browne and Miss Furlong. Take them in, Julia, with Miss Daly and Miss Power.\"\n\n\"I'm the man for the ladies,\" said Mr. Browne, pursing his lips until his moustache bristled and smiling in all his wrinkles. \"You know, Miss Morkan, the reason they are so fond of me is \u2014\u2014\u2014\"\n\nHe did not finish his sentence, but, seeing that Aunt Kate was out of earshot, at once led the three young ladies into the back room. The middle of the room was occupied by two square tables placed end to end, and on these Aunt Julia and the caretaker were straightening and smoothing a large cloth. On the sideboard were arrayed dishes and plates, and glasses and bundles of knives and forks and spoons. The top of the closed square piano served also as a sideboard for viands and sweets. At a smaller sideboard in one corner two young men were standing, drinking hop-bitters.\n\nMr. Browne led his charges thither and invited them all, in jest, to some ladies' punch, hot, strong and sweet. As they said they never took anything strong, he opened three bottles of lemonade for them. Then he asked one of the young men to move aside, and, taking hold of the decanter, filled out for himself a goodly measure of whisky. The young men eyed him respectfully while he took a trial sip.\n\n\"God help me,\" he said, smiling, \"it's the doctor's orders.\"\n\nHis wizened face broke into a broader smile, and the three young ladies laughed in musical echo to his pleasantry, swaying their bodies to and fro, with nervous jerks of their shoulders.
