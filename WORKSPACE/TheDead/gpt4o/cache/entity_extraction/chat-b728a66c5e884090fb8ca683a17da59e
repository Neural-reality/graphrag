We are met here as friends, in the spirit of good-fellowship, as colleagues, also to a certain extent, in the true spirit of camaraderie, and as the guests of\u2014what shall I call them?\u2014the Three Graces of the Dublin musical world.\"\n\nThe table burst into applause and laughter at this allusion. Aunt Julia vainly asked each of her neighbours in turn to tell her what Gabriel had said.\n\n\"He says we are the Three Graces, Aunt Julia,\" said Mary Jane.\n\nAunt Julia did not understand but she looked up, smiling, at Gabriel, who continued in the same vein:\n\n\"Ladies and Gentlemen,\n\n\"I will not attempt to play to-night the part that Paris played on another occasion. I will not attempt to choose between them. The task would be an invidious one and one beyond my poor powers. For when I view them in turn, whether it be our chief hostess herself, whose good heart, whose too good heart, has become a byword with all who know her, or her sister, who seems to be gifted with perennial youth and whose singing must have been a surprise and a revelation to us all to-night, or, last but not least, when I consider our youngest hostess, talented, cheerful, hard-working and the best of nieces, I confess, Ladies and Gentlemen, that I do not know to which of them I should award the prize.\"\n\nGabriel glanced down at his aunts and, seeing the large smile on Aunt Julia's face and the tears which had risen to Aunt Kate's eyes, hastened to his close. He raised his glass of port gallantly, while every member of the company fingered a glass expectantly, and said loudly:\n\n\"Let us toast them all three together. Let us drink to their health, wealth, long life, happiness and prosperity and may they long continue to hold the proud and self-won position which they hold in their profession and the position of honour and affection which they hold in our hearts.\"\n\nAll the guests stood up, glass in hand, and turning towards the three seated ladies, sang in unison, with Mr. Browne as leader:\n\n\"For they are jolly gay fellows,\nFor they are jolly gay fellows,\nFor they are jolly gay fellows,\nWhich nobody can deny.\"\n\nAunt Kate was making frank use of her handkerchief and even Aunt Julia seemed moved. Freddy Malins beat time with his pudding-fork and the singers turned towards one another, as if in melodious conference, while they sang with emphasis:\n\n\"Unless he tells a lie,\nUnless he tells a lie,\"\n\nThen, turning once more towards their hostesses, they sang:\n\n\"For they are jolly gay fellows,\nFor they are jolly gay fellows,\nFor they are jolly gay fellows,\nWhich nobody can deny.\"\n\nThe acclamation which followed was taken up beyond the door of the supper-room by many of the other guests and renewed time after time, Freddy Malins acting as officer with his fork on high.\n\n******\nThe piercing morning air came into the hall where they were standing so that Aunt Kate said:\n\n\"Close the door, somebody. Mrs. Malins will get her death of cold.\"\n\n\"Browne is out there, Aunt Kate,\" said Mary Jane.\n\n\"Browne is everywhere,\" said Aunt Kate, lowering her voice.\n\nMary Jane laughed at her tone.\n\n\"Really,\" she said archly, \"he is very attentive.\"\n\n\"He has been laid on here like the gas,\" said Aunt Kate in the same tone, \"all during the Christmas.\"\n\nShe laughed herself this time good-humouredly and then added quickly:\n\n\"But tell him to come in, Mary Jane, and close the door. I hope to goodness he didn't hear me.\"\n\nAt that moment the hall-door was opened and Mr. Browne came in from the doorstep, laughing as if his heart would break. He was dressed in a long green overcoat with mock astrakhan cuffs and collar and wore on his head an oval fur cap. He pointed down the snow-covered quay from where the sound of shrill prolonged whistling was borne in.\n\n\"Teddy will have all the cabs in Dublin out,\" he said.\n\nGabriel advanced from the little pantry behind the office, struggling into his overcoat and, looking round the hall, said:\n\n\"Gretta not down yet?\"\n\"She's getting on her things, Gabriel,\" said Aunt Kate.\n\n\"Who's playing up there?\" asked Gabriel.\n\n\"Nobody. They're all gone.\"\n\n\"O no, Aunt Kate,\" said Mary Jane. \"Bartell D'Arcy and Miss O'Callaghan aren't gone yet.\"\n\n\"Someone is fooling at the piano anyhow,\" said Gabriel.\n\nMary Jane glanced at Gabriel and Mr. Browne and said with a shiver:\n\n\"It makes me feel cold to look at you two gentlemen muffled up like that. I wouldn't like to face your journey home at this hour.\"\n\n\"I'd like nothing better this minute,\" said Mr. Browne stoutly, \"than a rattling fine walk in the country or a fast drive with a good spanking goer between the shafts.\"\n\n\"We used to have a very good horse and trap at home,\" said Aunt Julia sadly.\n\n\"The never-to-be-forgotten Johnny,\" said Mary Jane, laughing.\n\nAunt Kate and Gabriel laughed too.\n\n\"Why, what was wonderful about Johnny?\" asked Mr. Browne.\n\n\"The late lamented Patrick Morkan, our grandfather, that is,\" explained Gabriel, \"commonly known in his later years as the old gentleman, was a glue-boiler.\"\n\n\"O, now, Gabriel,\" said Aunt Kate, laughing, \"he had a starch mill.\"\n\n\"Well, glue or starch,\" said Gabriel, \"the old gentleman had a horse by the name of Johnny. And Johnny used to work\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
