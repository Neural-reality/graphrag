He lit a candle in the office and went before them to the stairs. They followed him in silence, their feet falling in soft thuds on the thickly carpeted stairs. She mounted the stairs behind the porter, her head bowed in the ascent, her frail shoulders curved as with a burden, her skirt girt tightly about her. He could have flung his arms about her hips and held her still, for his arms were trembling with desire to seize her and only the stress of his nails against the palms of his hands held the wild impulse of his body in check. The porter halted on the stairs to settle his guttering candle. They halted, too, on the steps below him. In the silence Gabriel could hear the falling of the molten wax into the tray and the thumping of his own heart against his ribs.\n\nThe porter led them along a corridor and opened a door. Then he set his unstable candle down on a toilet-table and asked at what hour they were to be called in the morning.\n\n\"Eight,\" said Gabriel.\nThe porter pointed to the tap of the electric-light and began a muttered apology, but Gabriel cut him short.\n\n\"We don't want any light. We have light enough from the street. And I say,\" he added, pointing to the candle, \"you might remove that handsome article, like a good man.\"\n\nThe porter took up his candle again, but slowly, for he was surprised by such a novel idea. Then he mumbled good-night and went out. Gabriel shot the lock to.\n\nA ghastly light from the street lamp lay in a long shaft from one window to the door. Gabriel threw his overcoat and hat on a couch and crossed the room towards the window. He looked down into the street in order that his emotion might calm a little. Then he turned and leaned against a chest of drawers with his back to the light. She had taken off her hat and cloak and was standing before a large swinging mirror, unhooking her waist. Gabriel paused for a few moments, watching her, and then said:\n\n\"Gretta!\"\n\nShe turned away from the mirror slowly and walked along the shaft of light towards him. Her face looked so serious and weary that the words would not pass Gabriel's lips. No, it was not the moment yet.\n\n\"You looked tired,\" he said.\n\n\"I am a little,\" she answered.\n\n\"You don't feel ill or weak?\"\n\n\"No, tired: that's all.\"\nShe went on to the window and stood there, looking out. Gabriel waited again and then, fearing that diffidence was about to conquer him, he said abruptly:\n\n\"By the way, Gretta!\"\n\n\"What is it?\"\n\n\"You know that poor fellow Malins?\" he said quickly.\n\n\"Yes. What about him?\"\n\n\"Well, poor fellow, he's a decent sort of chap, after all,\" continued Gabriel in a false voice. \"He gave me back that sovereign I lent him, and I didn't expect it, really. It's a pity he wouldn't keep away from that Browne, because he's not a bad fellow, really.\"\n\nHe was trembling now with annoyance. Why did she seem so abstracted? He did not know how he could begin. Was she annoyed, too, about something? If she would only turn to him or come to him of her own accord! To take her as she was would be brutal. No, he must see some ardour in her eyes first. He longed to be master of her strange mood.\n\n\"When did you lend him the pound?\" she asked, after a pause.\n\nGabriel strove to restrain himself from breaking out into brutal language about the sottish Malins and his pound. He longed to cry to her from his soul, to crush her body against his, to overmaster her. But he said:\n\n\"O, at Christmas, when he opened that little Christmas-card shop in Henry Street.\"\n\nHe was in such a fever of rage and desire that he did not hear her come from the window. She stood before him for an instant, looking at him strangely. Then, suddenly raising herself on tiptoe and resting her hands lightly on his shoulders, she kissed him.\n\n\"You are a very generous person, Gabriel,\" she said.\n\nGabriel, trembling with delight at her sudden kiss and at the quaintness of her phrase, put his hands on her hair and began smoothing it back, scarcely touching it with his fingers. The washing had made it fine and brilliant. His heart was brimming over with happiness. Just when he was wishing for it she had come to him of her own accord. Perhaps her thoughts had been running with his. Perhaps she had felt the impetuous desire that was in him, and then the yielding mood had come upon her. Now that she had fallen to him so easily, he wondered why he had been so diffident.\n\nHe stood, holding her head between his hands. Then, slipping one arm swiftly about her body and drawing her towards him, he said softly:\n\n\"Gretta, dear, what are you thinking about?\"\n\nShe did not answer nor yield wholly to his arm. He said again, softly:\n\n\"Tell me what it is, Gretta. I think I know what is the matter. Do I know?\"\n\nShe did not answer at once. Then she said in an outburst of tears:\n\"O, I am thinking about that song, The Lass of Aughrim.\"\n\nShe broke loose from him and ran to the bed and, throwing her arms across the bed-rail, hid her face. Gabriel stood stock-still for a moment in astonishment and then followed her. As he passed in the way of the cheval-glass he caught sight of himself in full length, his broad, wellfilled shirt-front, the face whose expression always puzzled him when he saw\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": 1}}
