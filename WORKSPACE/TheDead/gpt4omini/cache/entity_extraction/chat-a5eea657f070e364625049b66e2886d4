Her blue felt hat would show off the bronze of her hair against the darkness and the dark panels of her skirt would show off the light ones. Distant Music he would call the picture if he were a painter.\n\nThe hall-door was closed; and Aunt Kate, Aunt Julia and Mary Jane came down the hall, still laughing.\n\n\"Well, isn't Freddy terrible?\" said Mary Jane. \"He's really terrible.\"\n\nGabriel said nothing but pointed up the stairs towards where his wife was standing. Now that the hall-door was closed the voice and the piano could be heard more clearly. Gabriel held up his hand for them to be silent. The song seemed to be in the old Irish tonality and the singer seemed uncertain both of his words and of his voice. The voice, made plaintive by distance and by the singer's hoarseness, faintly illuminated the cadence of the air with words expressing grief:\n\n\"O, the rain falls on my heavy locks\nAnd the dew wets my skin,\nMy babe lies cold. . .\"\n\n\"O,\" exclaimed Mary Jane. \"It's Bartell D'Arcy singing and he wouldn't sing all the night. O, I'll get him to sing a song before he goes.\"\n\n\"O, do, Mary Jane,\" said Aunt Kate.\n\nMary Jane brushed past the others and ran to the staircase, but before she reached it the singing stopped and the piano was closed abruptly.\n\n\"O, what a pity!\" she cried. \"Is he coming down, Gretta?\"\n\nGabriel heard his wife answer yes and saw her come down towards them. A few steps behind her were Mr. Bartell D'Arcy and Miss O'Callaghan.\n\n\"O, Mr. D'Arcy,\" cried Mary Jane, \"it's downright mean of you to break off like that when we were all in raptures listening to you.\"\n\n\"I have been at him all the evening,\" said Miss O'Callaghan, \"and Mrs. Conroy, too, and he told us he had a dreadful cold and couldn't sing.\"\n\n\"O, Mr. D'Arcy,\" said Aunt Kate, \"now that was a great fib to tell.\"\n\n\"Can't you see that I'm as hoarse as a crow?\" said Mr. D'Arcy roughly.\n\nHe went into the pantry hastily and put on his overcoat. The others, taken aback by his rude speech, could find nothing to say. Aunt Kate wrinkled her brows and made signs to the others to drop the subject. Mr. D'Arcy stood swathing his neck carefully and frowning.\n\n\"It's the weather,\" said Aunt Julia, after a pause.\n\"Yes, everybody has colds,\" said Aunt Kate readily, \"everybody.\"\n\n\"They say,\" said Mary Jane, \"we haven't had snow like it for thirty years; and I read this morning in the newspapers that the snow is general all over Ireland.\"\n\n\"I love the look of snow,\" said Aunt Julia sadly.\n\n\"So do I,\" said Miss O'Callaghan. \"I think Christmas is never really Christmas unless we have the snow on the ground.\"\n\n\"But poor Mr. D'Arcy doesn't like the snow,\" said Aunt Kate, smiling.\n\nMr. D'Arcy came from the pantry, fully swathed and buttoned, and in a repentant tone told them the history of his cold. Everyone gave him advice and said it was a great pity and urged him to be very careful of his throat in the night air. Gabriel watched his wife, who did not join in the conversation. She was standing right under the dusty fanlight and the flame of the gas lit up the rich bronze of her hair, which he had seen her drying at the fire a few days before. She was in the same attitude and seemed unaware of the talk about her. At last she turned towards them and Gabriel saw that there was colour on her cheeks and that her eyes were shining. A sudden tide of joy went leaping out of his heart.\n\n\"Mr. D'Arcy,\" she said, \"what is the name of that song you were singing?\"\n\n\"It's called The Lass of Aughrim,\" said Mr. D'Arcy, \"but I couldn't remember it properly. Why? Do you know it?\"\n\n\"The Lass of Aughrim,\" she repeated. \"I couldn't think of the name.\"\n\n\"It's a very nice air,\" said Mary Jane. \"I'm sorry you were not in voice to-night.\"\n\n\"Now, Mary Jane,\" said Aunt Kate, \"don't annoy Mr. D'Arcy. I won't have him annoyed.\"\n\nSeeing that all were ready to start she shepherded them to the door, where good-night was said:\n\n\"Well, good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks for the pleasant evening.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Gabriel. Good-night, Gretta!\"\n\n\"Good-night, Aunt Kate, and thanks ever so much. Good-night, Aunt Julia.\"\n\n\"O, good-night, Gretta, I didn't see you.\"\n\n\"Good-night, Mr. D'Arcy.

A dull, yellow light brooded over the houses and the river; and the sky seemed to be descending. It was slushy underfoot; and only streaks and patches of snow lay on the roofs, on the parapets of the quay and on the area railings.
